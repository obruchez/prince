    * Morris Hayes mentions in an interview for [Violet (a French podcast about Prince)](https://podcast.ausha.co/violet/welcome-2-america-le-monde-selon-prince) that he didn't have the multitracks to work on the tracks, but only a stereo mixdown on CD-R, which means that he had to rip that CD-R and then add his parts. I wonder if the clicks we hear are from that specific step during the process. Either the CD-R Prince sent to Morris was faulty or the drive Morris used was not good enough. Either way, it's quite insane, but possible.

  * "Money Don’t Matter 2 Night"
    * TODO: check
    * Incorrect speed?
    * See [Prince.org](https://prince.org/msg/7/470977?&pg=2)
  * "My Tender Heart"
    * Posthumous remix by Chris James (aka "Frankenstein mix")
    * The version on *Diamonds And Pearls SDE* uses a later Ricky Peterson production (with bass, guitar, organ, keyboards, strings & The Steeles' backing vocals) instead of the original instrumentation from Prince's actual version
    * The song was originally recorded as "My Tender Love" (Rosie Gaines solo), then reworked as "My Tender Heart" (Prince's version), then a third version was released on *Concrete Jungle* (Rosie overdubbing to Prince's lyrics with both singing background vocals). The *Concrete Jungle* version shows how Prince's version should have sounded with the correct instrumentation.
    * See [TheSilentMikey's explanation](https://discord.com/channels/1156274456168239135/1156274456889667667/1381999944357122159)
* [*America (12" Version)*](https://princevault.com/index.php/Single:_America) (2025 remaster)
    * There's a buzzing sound during the last 7 seconds of the track (fade out)
    * Observations from [Kares](https://discord.com/channels/1156274456168239135/1156274456889667667/1390388616340963383)
      * "The new remaster plays slightly slower than the original, and even slower compared to the HDTracks version that came out in 2013 (?). So the HDTracks version is a little bit faster than the original, the 2025 version is a little bit slower."
      * "Both the HDTracks and the 2025 versions are flipped (inverted waveforms) compared to the original."
